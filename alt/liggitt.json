If something changes the object on the server between the get\nand the patch, the diff is going to show unrelated changes. We can now\nspecify the exact revisionversion that we want to patch, and that will\nreturn a conflict, and we can retry multiple times to get a\nnon-conflicting diff. Eventually (after 3 times), we diff without\nchecking the version and throw a warning that the diff might be\npartially wrong."}, {"Add": 19, "Del": 25, "Name": "Update github.com/json-iterator/go to
